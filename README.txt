MazeSolver Description: I implementented my maze solver using recursion where from the start element, I visit the four neighbour elements(top/down/left/right) recursively and keep going until a path is found or have reached all possible dead ends if no path exists. If an exit is found, I put the coordinate of that element onto the stack, and the coordinates of the elements leading to the it. To display the path, I pop off each element on the stack. I also marked the exit with a "#" (wall symbol), and repeated the process again until no more paths existed. I keep count of how many paths found and print it out at the end.
